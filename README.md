# Password-Strength-Experiment
Password complexity means using long, unpredictable combinations of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to make passwords difficult to guess or crack. Complex passwords resist brute-force and dictionary attacks, keeping accounts much safer
Key Learnings From Password Strength Evaluation
Length matters most: Passwords with 15+ characters are exponentially harder to crack.

Character variety boosts security: Including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases resistance to breaches.

Avoid dictionary patterns and common words: Predictable words or sequences are susceptible to dictionary and hybrid brute-force attacks.

Randomness and unpredictability: Randomized strings or phrases using unrelated words are more secure than simple modifications of common words.

Symbols/Numbers integration: Mixing symbols and numbers in all parts of a password—not just at the end—makes a difference.

Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Use passwords of at least 12–16 characters; longer is better.

Create passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

Avoid common phrases, keyboard sequences, and personal information.

Use passphrases—unrelated words combined into a memorable phrase or sentence.

Never reuse passwords across different accounts; each service deserves a unique password.

Consider a password manager for creating/storing complex, unique passwords for every account.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for extra protection.

Common Password Attacks and Impact of Complexity
Brute force attacks: Try every possible character combination. Short/simple passwords (<8 characters) can be cracked in seconds or minutes. Each extra character makes brute-force attacks exponentially harder.

Dictionary attacks: Use precompiled lists of common passwords or dictionary words. Even passwords with substitutions (like “P@ssw0rd”) are vulnerable if they use recognizable patterns.

Hybrid attacks: Combine dictionary and brute-force methods. Adding numbers/symbols to dictionary words is not sufficient unless randomness and length are present.

Credential stuffing: Attackers use leaked password-username pairs across multiple services. Unique passwords per site stop this from spreading.

Summary: Password Complexity & Security
Password complexity—achieved through length, unpredictable character use, and randomness—directly determines how well your password resists both brute-force and dictionary-based attacks. The more diverse, random, and lengthy your password, the less likely it is to be cracked, even by automated attacking tools running millions of guesses per second. Password managers and MFA provide essential layers beyond human memory and complexity. Always follow best practices to maintain security for your digital life
